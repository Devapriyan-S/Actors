<h1>Hello<h1>
<p>A greeting is a way to acknowledge someone with warmth and positivity, creating a sense of connection and welcome. Greetings vary across cultures, languages, and settings, but their purpose is universal: to convey respect, kindness, or even enthusiasm toward another person. Whether it’s a formal “Good morning,” an enthusiastic “Hey there!” or a simple wave, a greeting often sets the tone for the interaction that follows. In both personal and professional environments, a genuine greeting can make others feel appreciated and valued, fostering goodwill and strengthening relationships.</p>
